# SeleniumSetupForLinux
Just a repository to store my selenium setup in Linux (Ubuntu 20.04)

## Configuration
Best working configuration for settingup selenium in Ubuntu is here: https://tecadmin.net/setup-selenium-chromedriver-on-ubuntu/
But it does not tell you how to configure Eclipse IDE.

Basically after performing above steps you will need to add the JARs to the CLASSPATH (Not to the ModulePath) inside Java Build Path in the project properties.

That should be enough to have you covered.
